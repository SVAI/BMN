Bad MutatioN

Identifying potential drugs for schwannomas. 

## Mutation Annotation 

Annotating patient's mutations using ANNOVAR software.

## Identifying genes disregulated in schwannoma

Find the mutated genes that overlap with 1732 genes reported up/down regulated 
in a gene expressions study by Nielsen et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11965276.

## Lit review

Found deleterious mutations in three genes. There are 2 drugs inhibiting the function of one of them, ITPR3.
