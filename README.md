Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x9eSDz_M3nFdb4LovDShwnp9nWJR2DgZ_-fcHx4uHRI/edit?usp=sharing

Identifying potential drugs for schwannomas. 

## Mutation Annotation 

Annotating patient's mutations using ANNOVAR software.

## Identifying genes dysregulated in schwannoma

Find the mutated genes that overlap with 1732 genes reported as up/down-regulated 
in a gene expression study by Nielsen et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11965276.

## Lit review

Found deleterious mutations in three genes. There are 2 drugs inhibiting the function of one of them, ITPR3.
